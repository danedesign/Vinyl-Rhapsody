# Vinyl Rhapsody
 Vinyl Rhapsody is an AR interactive app that provides a new experience of showcasing and playing vinyl albums. The concept is to express artists' messages dimensionally and somewhat interact with their audience. It sets out to provide a visual translation to lyrics from the artists.
